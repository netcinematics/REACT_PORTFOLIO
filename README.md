# Web3folio 

- a REACT and NextJS PORTFOLIO of Web3 skills.
This Web3 Gallery was made with React, Next.JS, TailwindCSS, NPM, JSON, HTML5, CSS3, Alchemy, and Web3. Expanded, from the "Road to Web3" curriculum.

### OBJECTIVE
An open-source project for you (and anyone) to use as a TEMPLATE to display many WEB3 PROJECTS. Plus, a few EXPERIMENTS to continue to grow over time. Please replace ART with your own. 

------------------

## ALCHEMY FINAL-PROJECT PROPOSAL

> *WEB3folio* - a Web3 Project Gallery dApp, Front-End to multiple MAINNETS.

## DESCRIPTION / PROBLEM STATEMENT / SOLUTIONS

*Web3folio* dApp display many technical projects in one place. With text to help employers see clearly the amazing skills we gain at Alchemy University!

> The following list of CREATIVE SOLUTIONS details the LESSONS LEARNED, in each PROJECT. 

### CRYPTOBOOKZ
- dApp displays POLYGON MAINNET NFTs like pages of a book.
- double navigation, routes, and dynamic views in NEXTJS.
- looping navigation, pagination (over 100), and copy URL icon.  
- multi-media NFT GALLERY (audio tokens)

### SPAZAFALCON - AUDIO NFTs
- leverages NFTs as a multi-media art medium. Not just images. 
- a second example of Polygon NFTs loaded from MAINNET.

### PDF Resume and PDF Porfolio in NextJS (non-trivial)
- hide/show DETAILS, with LINKS to INTERACTIVE EXAMPLES.

-------------

## NEXT-STEPS
- Add Video and Audio into the CRYPTOBOOKZ experience.
- Add existing projects:
    - Web3_Tree, Web3 Ecosystem project.
    - AR/VR examples.
    - Pirate or Ninja CUSTOM CONTRACT experiment (biotokenz)

### BIOTOKENZ
Light-weight SOLUTION for DIGITAL-IDENTITY, Soul-Bound-Tokens (SBTs)

> CONCEPT: allow people to MINT SELF-ASSIGNED IDENTITY tokens, which other people can check using a dApp.

### PIRATE or NINJA?
A fun and light-hearted MVP for BIOTOKENZ concept. Where you self-assign your own identity. So you say you are not a bot? This is one way, among many, we can display Proof of Humanity (PoH).

> DESCRIPTION: extends the Alchemy projects of "Chain Battle" it is an EXPERIMENT in CUSTOM SMART-CONTRACTS and advanced UI/UX features.
