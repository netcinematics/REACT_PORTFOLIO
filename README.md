- LOOP nav, pagination (over 100), and copy URL icon.  
- MULTI-MEDIA audio tokens
- MOBILE RESPONSIVE.

### SPAZAFALCON - AUDIO NFTs

- Also, a second example of Polygon NFTs loaded from MAINNET.

### PDF Resume and PDF Porfolio in NextJS (non-trivial)

-------------

## NEXT-STEPS
- Add Video and Audio, as MULTI-MEDIA CRYPTOBOOKZ experience.
- Add Token METADATA display: Attributes, Token SYMBOL, contract type, link to blockexplorer or rarible.
- Add existing projects:
    - Web3_Tree, Web3 Ecosystem project.
    - AR/VR examples.
    - Pirate or Ninja CUSTOM CONTRACT experiment (biotokenz)

### BIOTOKENZ
Light-weight SOLUTION for DIGITAL-IDENTITY, Soul-Bound-Tokens (SBTs)

> CONCEPT: allow people to MINT SELF-ASSIGNED IDENTITY tokens, which other people can check using a dApp.

### PIRATE or NINJA?
A fun and light-hearted MVP for BIOTOKENZ concept. Where you self-assign your own identity. So you say you are not a bot? This is one way, among many, we can display Proof of Humanity (PoH).

> DESCRIPTION: extends the Alchemy projects of "Chain Battle" it is an EXPERIMENT in CUSTOM SMART-CONTRACTS and advanced UI/UX features.
